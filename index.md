I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Stanford Uniforsity, advised by <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/">Stephen Boyd</a> and <a href="https://stanford.edu/~pilanci/">Mert Pilanci</a>. Prior to joining Stanford, I obtained my bachelor's degree from the University of British Columbia, majoring in combined honors computer science and math. My research interest lies broadly in convex optimization and deep learning.
